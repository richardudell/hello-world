# hello-world
Created with guidance from Code Carpentry GitHub guide for Hello-World (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

My name is Richard and I like rocks!  My friends call me the "Rock Guy".  I love it because they send me pictures of cool geology that they see on hikes or drives and I get a chance to geek out with them about how something possibly formed! 
A little bit more about me is...  I like to run.  I especially like running on trails but I rarely do that during the weekdays.  The perfect weekend for me involves seeing the people I care about, getting good rest, and at least one awesome trail run!  And, ideally I'll take a picture of some awesome geology and geek out about it!
